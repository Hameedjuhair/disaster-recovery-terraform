## 🧾 Demo Narration Script – Disaster Recovery as Code (DRAC)

---

### 🎬 Intro

```
🚀 Welcome to DRAC: Disaster Recovery as Code using Terraform + AWS.

In this demo, we'll simulate 4 disaster recovery test cases and validate auto-recovery and alerts.
```

---

### ✅ STEP 1: Launch the Infrastructure

```
📁 Navigate to: envs/us-east-1
🖥️ Run the following:
    terraform init
    terraform apply

✅ Infrastructure deployed in us-east-1:
- VPC
- EC2 instance
- RDS (MySQL)
- Lambda
- CloudWatch Alarm
- SNS Topic
- S3 Bucket
```

---

### 🧪 STEP 2: EC2 Instance Failure Simulation

```
🧪 Test Case 1: EC2 Failure Recovery

1️⃣ Go to AWS Console → EC2
2️⃣ Stop the instance (manually)
3️⃣ Wait for 1 minute

🛠️ In terminal:
    terraform taint module.ec2.aws_instance.drac_server
    terraform apply

✅ EC2 instance recreated by Terraform
```

---

### 🧪 STEP 3: RDS Alert via CloudWatch

```
🧪 Test Case 2: Simulate RDS Low Storage

1️⃣ Go to AWS Console → RDS
2️⃣ Stop the RDS instance

⏱️ Wait ~1-2 minutes

✅ CloudWatch detects low storage
✅ SNS sends email alert: "RDS Low Storage"

### 🧪 STEP 4: Subnet Availability Zone Failure

```
🧪 Test Case 3: Simulate AZ Subnet Isolation

1️⃣ Modify main.tf to use only subnet B
2️⃣ Stop EC2 and RDS from AWS Console
3️⃣ Reapply Terraform to fallback into alternate subnet

✅ Services recover in available subnet
```

---

### 🧪 STEP 5: Lambda + SNS Trigger

```
🧪 Test Case 4: Manually Trigger Lambda

1️⃣ Go to AWS Console → Lambda → Select drac-prod-dr-lambda
2️⃣ Click "Test" or run via AWS CLI:
    aws lambda invoke --function-name drac-prod-dr-lambda --payload '{}' output.json

✅ Lambda function executes
✅ SNS email alert received
```

---

### ✅ Final Verification

```
✅ EC2 auto-recovery: PASSED
✅ RDS alert email: PASSED
✅ Subnet fallback: PASSED
✅ Lambda-SNS trigger: PASSED

🎉 DRAC demo completed successfully!
